        "Currently the fastest (and least expensive) way to get data into DynamoDB is to use the ImportTable API call. The problem is that it only accepts CSV, DynamoDB JSON, or ION formats. What if you have a different data format? You would have to build an entire orchestrated process to transform and handle errors. This workflow uses the newly released Distributed Map feature to fix this gap by automating the transformation of JSON to DynamoDB JSON and importing into DynamoDB. The best part is that this workflow can be easily adapted to convert any type of data needed."
