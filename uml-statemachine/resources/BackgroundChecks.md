# BackgroundChecks State Machine

`BackgroundChecks` is a UML state machine that models parallel behavior using an **orthogonal** state. The next figure shows the UML model, representing background checks.

There are only two main states: `RunningChecks` and `Cancelled`. `RunningChecks` is orthogonal and consists of two **regions**, which execute in parallel: `CheckingCriminal` and `CheckingFinancial`. When both complete, `RunningChecks` also completes and we transition to the final state, running the transition activity `consolidateResults`. 

Locate the Step Functions state machine whose name starts with `BlogBackgroundChecks`, shown in the next figure:

Execute the `BlogServiceRequest` state machine by choosing **Start Execution** for that state machine in the Step Functions console.  Use the following input:

```
{ "appData": "Insert your JSON here"}
```

Confirm in the **Graph View** that it stops in `Run Criminal Check` and `Run Background Check`.

In the **Event View**, find the **Task Input** for `Run Criminal Check`. Copy the `taskToken` value, excluding the double quotes. Your value will be different from that shown in the diagram.

In the Lambda console, find the function whose name contains `BlogDummyUMLEventDispatcher`. In the **Test** tab, create an event whose **Event JSON** resembles the following; paste your task token where indicated.

```
{
  "taskToken": "<paste your task token here>",
  "trigger": "criminalCheckDone",
  "appData": {
    "x": "y"
  }
}
```

Choose **Test** to call the Lambda function with that input. It triggers the workflow. When it completes, return to the **Graph View** of the Step Functions workflow. It has now completed the `Run Criminal Check` path of the flow, but it is still paused at `Run Financial Check`.

Find the task token for `Run Financial Check` -- it will be different from the token for `Run Criminal Check` -- and in the Lambda console create a test event of the following form using the task token.

```
{
  "taskToken": "<paste your task token here>",
  "trigger": "financialCheckDone",
  "appData": {
    "x": "y"
  }
}
```

Choose **Test** to call the Lambda function with that input. It triggers the workflow. The workflow is complete.

Here are some design notes on the Step Functions implementation:
- The orthogonal regions are represented using a parallel state, the left side handling criminal checks, the right side financial.  In general, if the logic of a region is sufficiently complex, it can be moved into its own Step Function state machine and invoked such that the parent machine waits for it to complete.
- We have two callbacks at once: one for `Run Criminal Check`, another for `Run Financial Check`.  Each has its own token.
- As opposed to explicit cancellation handling in the `Service Request` implementation, cancellation here is handled outside the state machine. To cancel the background checks, the external actor stops the state machine using the Step Functions API. The UML model requires a transition activity called `recordCancellation`, the external actor needs to implement that logic too. External cancellation is a good choice when wrapup logic is simple; it leverages the API rather than complicating the flow with cancellation detail.

## Patterns Demonstrated
- Parallel or orthogonal states
- Cancellation events handled outside the flow using SDK
