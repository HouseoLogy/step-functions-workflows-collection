    "description": "A webhook provider is a service or system that offers the capability to send outgoing webhook notifications to external systems or applications. A webhook is an HTTP callback that sends a notification to a predefined URL (endpoint) when a specific event or trigger occurs. Webhooks allow real-time communication and data exchange between different systems or services.",

       "When an event that matches the configured filter conditions is triggered,\nthe step function handles the flow of retrieving event data and validates if the customer has set up a webhook subscription for the event.\nIf a valid subscription exists, it prepares the webhook call, queues the call, and updates the webhook call entry in DynamoDB. \nThe queue entry triggers a lambda function that calls the webhook. The retry interval and count along with backoff settings can be configured."
