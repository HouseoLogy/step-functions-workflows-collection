The State Machine processes a list of images and retrieves objects metadata and image labels using machine learning in parallel, ultimately storing the result as one entry in the DynamoDB table.  This pattern demonstrates how step functions can work with multiple data stores, manipulate, merge and store data for later prcessing."
